## Sublime Text 3 Snippets

A collection of useful sublime snippets I've made. You can throw these in `/Users/$USER/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User` (this is the path if you have sublime text 3 installed). Each snippet has a `<tabtrigger>` which is what is used to generate the snippet.
